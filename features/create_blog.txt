Feature: Create Blog
  As an author
  In order to gift my thoughts to the world
  I want to create a blog

  Scenario: Create blog page shown      #features/create_blog.feature:6
    Given I am on the home page         #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:68
    Then I should see "Welcome"         #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:129
    And I should see "My Shiny Weblog!" #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:129

  Scenario: Create blog page not shown when blog created #features/create_blog.feature:11
    Given the blog is set up                   #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:34
    When I am on the home page                 #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:68
    Then I should not see "My Shiny Weblog!"   #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:147
    And I should see "Teh Blag"                #features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:129
